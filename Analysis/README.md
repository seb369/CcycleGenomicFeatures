# Analysis

This directory contains all analysis performed for this study all of which was done in R with rMarkdown. The analyses were split into the following sets:

* **Genome_feature_testing_ACcharacters**: Analysis of 13C labeled contigs, linking genomic investment at the community level to C assimilation and growth dynamics.
* **labeled_MAGs_redo**: Analysis of 13C labeled MAGs, linking genomic investment at the genome level to C assimilation and growth dynamics.
* **OtherStudy_genome_feat_analysis**: Assessing genomic features linked to life history strategy in 7 other genome/metagenome datasets.
* **predict_LHS_labeled_MAGs**: Using genomic features to predict life history strategies in MAGs and RefSoil genomes.

For these analyses, rMarkdown files (.Rmd) include the raw code while markdown files (.md) contain the knitted code and output.
